Manual analysis of conversations

SUMMARY:
- Referring to the explanation: it refers to the explanation that LearnLM is internally represented with, but the student does not see this.
-- Leaking the answer: saying that the explanation includes a counterexample
+ Effective grounding: frequently asks users to define or explain in their own words.
+ Misconception identification and gives room/guidance on that the student is nearly there but gives hints for next steps.
+ Engaging users with examples and intuitive analogies.


ADJUSTMENT IDEAS:
- Fix LaTeX:
	- data 2025-06-11 18_05_37.pkl
	"$\mathbf u=(1,0,0),\quad \mathbf v=(0,1,0),\quad \mathbf w=(1,1,0). $"
	- data 2025-06-12 17_41_29.pkl
- Good LaTeX example:
	- data 2025-06-12 16_24_06.pkl
- When asked for def., just provide them
- Adjust prompt to include university style
- Maybe if answer==True --> give examples directly. If answer==False --> do not give examples because they could be counter examples.


Q1:
data 2025-06-11 16_07_06.pkl
- Refers to the explanations in the output (which is in the prompt)
data 2025-06-12 09_49_54.pkl
- only 2 turns where user asks in 1 turn what lin. dep. is
data 2025-06-11 18_05_37.pkl
- Gives away the answer by saying that in the explanation it says that (1) and (2) are lin. ind., but (3) is lin. dep. Student does not notice this.
data 2025-06-12 10_14_49.pkl
+ Grounds user by asking what it thinks lin. dep. is. User rejects and says does not know, system correctly explains.
+ User gives wrong example, a matrix, but probably means 2 vectors. The vectors are linearly independent, but the system asks the user to justify why they are lin. ind.
data 2025-06-12 14_50_26.pkl
- Refers to the explanations in the output (which is in the prompt)
- Gives answer away as explanation includes counterexample
+ User does not know what linear independence is and system explains it by the user of lin. combinations, but gets a little bit side tracked.
data 2025-06-12 16_09_28.pkl
- Refers to the explanations in the output (which is in the prompt)
+ User directly asks for a counterexample as it suspect it is False, then system asks to remind the user of what a lin. ind. set is.

Q3:
data 2025-06-11 15_07_33.pkl
- Refers to the explanations in the output (which is in the prompt)
